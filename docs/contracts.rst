Standard Contracts

Multiple Contracts
==================
A single file can define multiple contracts. In this case, the last contract acts as the main contract and is what gets compiled.
Other contracts are dependencies.

In the following example, a standard P2PKH contract is rewritten using two other contracts: a hash puzzle contract that checks the public key matches the public key hash, and a Pay-to-PubKey (P2PK) contract that verifies signature matches public key.

.. code-block:: solidity

    contract HashPuzzle {
        Ripemd160 hash;

        public function spend(bytes preimage) {
            require(hash160(preimage) == this.hash);
        }
    }

    contract Pay2PubKey {
        PubKey pubKey;

        public function spend(Sig sig) {
            require(checkSig(sig, this.pubKey));
        }
    }

    contract Pay2PubKeyHash {
        Ripemd160 pubKeyHash;

        public function spend(Sig sig, PubKey pubKey) {
            HashPuzzle hp = new HashPuzzle(this.pubKeyHash);
            require(hp.spend(pubKey));

            Pay2PubKey p2pk = new Pay2PubKey(pubKey);
            require(p2pk.spend(sig));
        }
    }


import
======
Alternatively, the contact above can be broken into three files. The ``Pay2PubKeyHash`` contact ``import``\s other two contracts as dependencies.
This allows reusing contracts written by others and forms the basis of contract libraries.

A contract can be instantiated by ``new``. A ``public`` function can be called from ``require``, which takes boolean expression as input.

.. code-block:: solidity

    import "./hashPuzzle.scrypt";
    import "./p2pk.scrypt";

    contract Pay2PubKeyHash {
        Ripemd160 pubKeyHash;

        public function spend(Sig sig, PubKey pubKey) {
            HashPuzzle hp = new HashPuzzle(this.pubKeyHash);
            require(hp.spend(pubKey));

            Pay2PubKey p2pk = new Pay2PubKey(pubKey);
            require(p2pk.spend(sig));
        }
    }


Standard Contracts
==================
sCrypt comes with standard libraries that define many commonly used contracts. They are included by default and do not require explicit ``import`` to be used.

The following example shows usage of the standard contract ``P2PKH`` that corresponds to Pay-to-PubKey-Hash contract.

.. code-block:: solidity

    contract P2PKHStdDemo {
        Ripemd160 pubKeyHash;

        public function unlock(Sig sig, PubKey pubKey) {
            P2PKH p2pkh = new P2PKH(this.pubKeyHash);
            require(p2pkh.spend(sig, pubKey));
        }
    }


Contract ``OP_PUSH_TX``
-----------------------
One grave misconception regarding bitcoin script is that its access is only limited to the data provided in the locking script and corresponding unlocking script.
Thus, its scope and capability are greatly underestimated.

sCrypt comes with a powerful contract called ``Tx`` that allows inspection of the **ENTIRE TRANSACTION** containing the contract itself, besides the locking script and unlocking script.
It can be regarded as a pseudo opcode ``OP_PUSH_TX`` that pushes the current transaction into the stack, which can be inspected at runtime.
More precisely, it enables inspection of the preimage used in signature verification defined in `BIP143`_.
The format of the preimage is as follows:

    1. nVersion of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
    2. hashPrevouts (32-byte hash)
    3. hashSequence (32-byte hash)
    4. outpoint (32-byte hash + 4-byte little endian) 
    5. scriptCode of the input (serialized as scripts inside CTxOuts)
    6. value of the output spent by this input (8-byte little endian)
    7. nSequence of the input (4-byte little endian)
    8. hashOutputs (32-byte hash)
    9. nLocktime of the transaction (4-byte little endian)
    10. sighash type of the signature (4-byte little endian)

As an example, contract ``CheckLockTimeVerify`` ensures coins are timelocked and cannot be spent before ``matureTime`` is reached, similar to `OP_CLTV`_.

.. code-block:: solidity

    contract CheckLockTimeVerify {
        int matureTime;

        public function spend(bytes sighashPreimage) {
            // this ensures the preimage is for the current tx
            require(Tx.checkPreimage(sighashPreimage));
            
            // parse nLocktime
            int len = length(sighashPreimage);
            int nLocktime = this.fromLEUnsigned(sighashPreimage[len - 8 : len - 4]);

            require(nLocktime >= this.matureTime);
        }
        
        function fromLEUnsigned(bytes b) returns (int) {
            // append positive sign byte. This does not hurt even when sign bit is already positive
            return unpack(b + b'00');
        }
    }

To customize ECDSA signing, such as choosing ephemeral key, there is a more general version called `TxAdvanced <https://medium.com/@xiaohuiliu/advanced-op-push-tx-78ce84f69a66>`_.
